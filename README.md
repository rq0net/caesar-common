# Caesar Common

This project is generated using [Cookiecutter Django](https://github.com/cookiecutter/cookiecutter-django), a framework for jumpstarting production-ready Django projects quickly.

## Installation instructions using poetry.

1. Create the pyproject.toml based on environment
```bash
cp pyproject.${ENVIRON}.toml pyproject.toml
```
This requires an environment variable called ENVIRON to be present (already a part of build.env.py)

2. Set the python version for poetry
```bash
poetry env use 3.9.0
```
This requires python 3.9.0 is already installed in the system.

3. Install the packages based on pyproject.toml
```bash
poetry install --without dev,test
```
This installs in a dedicated virtualenv for the project poetry creates in the background by itself. For local setup, include dev and test too.

4. Enter the poetry shell
```bash
poetry shell
```
This activates the virtualenv and allows interacting with our application using python manage.py <...>

## Setting Up the Project

1. Environment Variables
It is suggested to have build.uat.env.py file in the parent directory of this repository. Necessary env variables can then be loaded as follows.
```bash
cd ../
python build.uat.env.py
```
Following that, execute the first three commands returned by the above script. Note that if you are using a shell that colorizes grep, pass the `--color=never` flag as well.

2. Database Setup
```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

3. Create a superuser:
```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

4. Static and Media Files
```bash
python manage.py collectstatic
```

5. Create media directory (not in use):
```bash
mkdir -p media
```

## Running the Development Server

Start the Django development server:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```
The application will be available at http://127.0.0.1:8000/.
You can edit the port accordingly for the microservice and nginx configuration.

## Running Tests
To run the tests for the application, use:
```bash
python manage.py test
```

## Common Management Commands

1. Creating new app:
```bash
python manage.py startapp <app_name>
```

2. Running Django shell:
```bash
python manage.py shell
```

3. Making migrations:
```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

## Deployment

- Make sure any new environment variable you need is added to the env.yaml.j2 under /charts
- Make sure you add the associated Jira Key in your commit message.
- After publishing the code to either UAT, Staging or Main branch, trigger a deployment from Jenkins.
